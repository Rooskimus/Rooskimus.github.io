                </h2>
                <p>In 2007 I found myself graduating with a degree in Physics from the University of Idaho, but I had also discovered that I had a knack for the Japanese language and strongly desired to experience the country.  So, I found a company that would sponsor a visa for me and left to teach English in Japan in 2008.  Shortly after, the markets crashed.  I had only intended a stay of a year or two, but I was employed which was more than many people back home could say.  So I stayed.</p>
                <p>And then, you guessed it, I got married to a Japanese woman.  We decided that we didn't want a pressure-cooker school environment for our kids, so after our first was born we moved back to the US.  After having lived for 8 years in Japan, I felt a little out of place and disconnected from those around me.  Aside from my old high school friends, all of my personal and professional connections are scattered far and wide across the globe!  I've been doing jobs to get by, but now I have found a field in which I can truly connect to my peers and produce work of value. Something I can be proud of.</p>
                <p class="mb=0">My first break in the industry has turned out to be more of a preface than a chapter.  But that's part and parcel for working in a startup environment. Sometimes sudden changes due to budget constraints happen.  I am ready to begin a new chapter in earnest!</p>
